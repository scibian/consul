Description: service discovery and configuration tool - main package
 Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. Consul is
 distributed, highly available, and extremely scalable. Consul provides
 several key features:
  * Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register
    themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface.
    External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.
  * Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert
    operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service
    discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service
    level circuit breakers.
  * Key/Value Storage - A flexible key/value store enables storing
    dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and
    more. The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use anywhere.
  * Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can
    support any number of regions without complex configuration.
 .
 This is the main package. It installs the consul binary, which is the only
 required component on both client and server nodes.
